Hmm... this loudred appears to be trying to say something.

> Loudred LOUDRED Loudred!

It seems like they're saying... that they're a Discord Audio Bot that streams audio from a MacOS audio device?

## Motivations

This is quite strange. Wild Loudred don't usually venture out this way. Why are you here, Loudred?

> Loudred Loud!

They're saying that they're here to fix a limitation with [Go Live with Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040816151-Share-your-screen-with-Go-Live-Screen-Share) on MacOS. Currently, MacOS users are unable to stream audio through this service, but by adding Loudred as a bot, you can stream audio through it.
