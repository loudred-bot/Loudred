## Public-facing changes

<!-- List any changes that might effect how end-users use this bot (changes to commands, new startup options, etc...). You don't have to go in-depth, but try to be comprehensive! -->

## Internal changes

You don't have to list EVERY change (that's what code review is for!) but try to give a broad overview of these changes and your reasons for making them. -->
