## Public-facing changes

<!-- List any changes that might effect how end-users use this bot (changes to commands, new startup options, etc...). You don't have to go in-depth, but try to be comprehensive! -->

## Internal changes

<!-- List any changes to the internal APIs that may effect how developers work on this bot (i.e. new methods on the botWrapper, file reorganization, etc...). You don't have to list EVERY change (that's what code review is for!) but try to give a broad overview of these changes and your reasons for making them. -->
